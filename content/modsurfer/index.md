Check out the [gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl_jp1rkMa8) on YouTube.

All PAL Amigas are supported. Larger MODs will need more chip RAM. Hard disk installation is supported. No Amiga? No problem! Also works great in WinUAE and FS-UAE on your platform of choice.

This was my entry into the 2018 English Amiga Board game development competition.

No MODs? I've curated a collection of tracks that play great in ModSurfer. Unpack them to your hard disk or use the ADF floppy images. Track 0 is a warm-up, feel free to skip if you're good! *I'm not affiliated with the MOD composers, just a fan.*

This game was written in C and assembly and cross-compiled with the amiga-gcc port. It includes the public domain MOD replayer ptplayer. Browse the [source code](https://github.com/amigageek/modsurfer) online at GitHub.
